# Terminal Pomodoro
This runs on terminal with voice inputs for uniterrupted work

Possible Enhancements:
- Start logging work and break
- May be with timestamps?
- Could be json dumps to begin with, and can extend the logic to a db
- Simple dashboard to track the progress
- Browser interface may be?
